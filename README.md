Challenge problem for econfiy

Please implement a Node.JS server with a GraphQL based API that has the abilities to Create, Read, Update, & Delete Locations & Events. We would also like to be able to query and find all the locations & events belonging to an organization, as well as the reverse: being able to query a location(s) / event(s) and having the ability to find the organization it belongs to.

This is what the schema of the the (persistent) database should look like:

    Organization- Name- CreatedAt- UpdatedAt
    Locations (belongs to Organization):- Name- Address- Latitude- Longitude- CreatedAt- UpdatedAt
    Events (belongs to Organization):- Name- Date / Time (can modify these columns to fit your needs better. Doesnâ€™t have to be exactly one column)- Description- CreatedAt- UpdatedAt

Bonus: When a user submits a location with an address, the latitude & longitude is gathered via the Google Places API
